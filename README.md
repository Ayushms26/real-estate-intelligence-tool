# Real Estate Analytics and Price Prediction System

This project is a complete end-to-end real estate analytics solution that helps users estimate flat prices, analyze market trends, identify good investment opportunities, and receive personalized flat recommendations. It goes beyond traditional listing platforms by offering data-driven decision support.

## Project Motivation

Real estate platforms like 99acres or MagicBricks list properties with basic details like price, location, and number of rooms. However, they don't answer critical questions such as:

- Is this flat priced fairly?
- Is it a good investment for me?
- Which area gives better value or ROI?

This project was built to address these questions using real-world data and machine learning.

## Key Features

- Price Prediction using ML models
- Market trend analysis using EDA
- Insights on overvalued and undervalued areas
- ROI calculation based on rental yield and price growth
- Flat recommendation system based on user preferences
